# Mafia
Mafia game round 1.

---

## Intent
Built in a summer afternoon of 2015 (without much Android/Java knowledge) to conduct round 1 of mafia game because we didn't have enough players to have a "god" conduct the game. This simple app would simulate round 1 of a typical Mafia game with "god" voice played by my Brother! :)

---

## Features
This will just play the part of god for the following:
- Assign roles to characters randomly
- Walk city to sleep and wake with mafias selecting person to kill
- Doctor with choice to save the killed person
- Detective with a guess at mafia
- and City waking to find if someone is dead or not
That's all :)
Future rounds will be conducted by whoever is thrown out at end of round 1 :P

---

### Known Bugs
This will crash after finishing it's job of conducting round 1 if more operations are tried.
Restart the apps for more rounds.
